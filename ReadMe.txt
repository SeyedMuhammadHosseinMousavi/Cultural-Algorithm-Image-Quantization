%% Cultural Algorithm Image Quantization - Created in 16 Jan 2022 by Seyed Muhammad Hossein Mousavi
% This code, takes a input image and applies Otsuâ€™s thresholding method 
% based on user's threshold levels on
% image for quantization. Then the achieved vector from previews step sends
% to Cultural Algorithm cycle to be fitted even better. You can change
% parameters and input image as you desired.
